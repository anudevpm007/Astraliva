      "At Inkogsek, we are dedicated to identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices. Our expertise lies in thoroughly analyzing these devices across multiple layers, including hardware, firmware, network services, and applications. We take a comprehensive approach to ensure that all potential weak points are scrutinized and fortified. By examining the physical hardware, we assess for any design flaws or potential points of attack. Our firmware analysis focuses on the software that runs on these devices, checking for coding errors or security loopholes that could be exploited. We also evaluate network services to secure communication channels and prevent unauthorized access. Finally, our application assessments ensure that the software running on these devices is robust against potential threats. This multi-faceted strategy allows us to provide complete protection against a wide range of cyber threats, ensuring that IoT and embedded devices are secure from potential attacks and vulnerabilities.",
